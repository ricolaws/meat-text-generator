<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project was created with the Bacon Ipsum API from baconipsum.com, and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can select how many paragraphs of text you would like and whether the text should be pure meat, or meat words with some latin sprinkled in..
Then the app sends a request to the API and gets your meat words! Simple!

This project also features a cute pig that runs away when your cursor lands on it.
